No installation required for this project.

Python packages required for utilizing the data:
matplotlib
plotly
requests

What I learned:

This project took me about a week at an hour or two a day.
I had no idea there would be so many useful python packages to make plotting data
onto a graph so accessible. I was expecting it to be much more difficult. I had
considered delving into some data science because I've noticed how well some of
those jobs pay! I really enjoyed creating data visualizations and may look further
into it.

I tracked my progress on this portion of the book on my github as well, just in case.
